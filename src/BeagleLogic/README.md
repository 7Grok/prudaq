You need the script in this directory if you're accessing PRUDAQ
through the BeagleLogic system image, as described in the QuickStart:
https://github.com/google/prudaq/wiki/QuickStart

If you're using the sample code in this repo instead ("Option 2" in the
QuickStart), the script here won't do you any good.
